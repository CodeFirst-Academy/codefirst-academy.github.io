            <h3>Introduction to Programming and Game Design in Python</h3>
            <p>Through making fun and exciting classic games, we teach students
               introductory programming concepts to kickstart their interest and develop a foundation in computer science. In this course, we use Python
               and PyGame to start their programming journey in an accessible yet powerful language, allowing them to keep growing their skills in the future.
               This course is tailored to students in grades 5-8 and is accessible to those with no previous programming background.

            <h3>High School/AP Computer Science</h3>
            <br>
            <p>We go through the critical parts of the College Board AP Computer 
              Science* curriculum and develop cornerstone knowledge in Java, the industry leading programming language. Through this process, we grow your student's understanding of programming,
              both practically and theoretically. We will use AP Exam practice material to create an authentic learning experience that matches high school CS education closely. 
              We will also take diagnostic tests at the start and end of the week to help give a metric of growth for the student.
              This course is recommended to students in 8-12th grade that are planning on taking
               high school computer science, especially those interested in the AP exam.
                Younger students with previous programming experience may join as well. Student with prior experience will get independent attention to accelerate their knowledge through advanced problems & tips.

		<div class="container">
	
		 <p>
            Requirements are minimal. We will be using Zoom, a free service, to host the classes. 
            To code, we use <a href="https://repl.it/">Repl.it</a> online, so no downloads are needed.  All that is needed for this class is a computer with internet access (Chromebooks work) and a microphone.
            We highly recommend having a web camera to ensure engagement, but it is not required. <br>
            If you have any questions about the curriculum or want advice for level placement for your child, feel free to contact us.
            <br><br>
            *Note: We are not affilited with College Board nor their AP Computer Science test in any way.
